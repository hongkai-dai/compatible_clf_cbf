We search for the compatible CLF and CBF function of a nonlinear dynamical system with 2 states

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}_0 =& u\\
\dot{x}_1 =& -x_0 + \frac{1}{6}x_0^3 - u
\end{align*}
$$
We will consider the case with or without the input limits on $u$.

This system is introduced in *Searching for control Lyapunov functions using sums-of-squares programming* by Weehong Tan and Andrew Packard.
